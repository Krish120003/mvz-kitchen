    aboutTheDish:
      "Chana Bhatura, also known as Chole Bhature, is a beloved North Indian dish that combines two culinary masterpieces. The bhatura is a deep-fried, pillow-soft bread made from refined flour and yogurt, creating its signature puffy texture and golden color. Paired with rich, aromatic chole (chana masala) - chickpeas slow-cooked in a blend of traditional spices including cumin, coriander, and garam masala. This iconic combination has been a street food favorite across Punjab and North India for generations, representing the perfect balance of textures and flavors that make Indian cuisine so special. Whether you call it Chana Bhatura or Chole Bhature, this hearty dish delivers authentic taste and satisfying comfort food experience.",
